When I was 15, I asked myself: what if I stumbled upon a German WW2 encrypted message, but I didn't have an Enigma machine to dechiper it? So I built one myself. Actually, I wrote a program in Java to simulate it. And I generalized it, so anyone can make their own custom machine!

This was my first programming project (apart from some basic LED blinking with Arduino), so I had to learn a lot. The result is [on my GitHub](github.com/marcellofonda/enigma)

## What I learnt in a nutshell
This was my first major programming project
* How the Enigma machine works
* 3 programming languages:
  * C, my first try. After I learnt the basics I realized it wasn't what I was looking for, since I needed objects
  * C++, the natural second try. After learning the key concepts, I got tangled up with garbage collection
  * Java, my final attempt. Automatic garbage collection was the thing
* Basic object-oriented programming principles:
  * Classes and instances
  * Private and public attributes and methods
  * Inheritance
* Basic `git` funcionality
* Structuring code in multiple files
* Commenting code
