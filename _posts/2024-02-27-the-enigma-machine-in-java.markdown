I asked myself: what if I stumbled upon a German WW2 encrypted message, but I didn't have an Enigma machine to dechiper it? So I built one myself. Actually, I wrote a program in Java to simulate it. And I generalized it, so anyone can make their own custom machine!

The code is [on my GitHub](github.com/marcellofonda/enigma)

## What I learnt in a nutshell
* How the Enigma machine works
* The Java programming language
* Basic `git` funcionality
* Basic object-oriented programming principles:
  * Classes and instances
  * Private and public attributes and methods
  * Inheritance
* Structuring code in multiple files
* Commenting code
