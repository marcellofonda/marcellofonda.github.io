## TLDR - Quick overview

Back in 2016, I wrote a program in Java to enchiper messages using the WW2 German Enigma system. Actually, I generalized it to arbitrary alphabets, number of wheels, etc.

The result is [on my GitHub](github.com/marcellofonda/enigma)

## What I learnt
* How the Enigma machine works
* The Java programming language
* Basic `git` funcionality
* Basic object-oriented programming principles:
  * Classes and instances
  * Private and public attributes and methods
  * Inheritance
* Structuring code in multiple files
* Commenting code
