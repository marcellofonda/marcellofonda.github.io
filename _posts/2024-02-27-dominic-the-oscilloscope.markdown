Can digital oscilloscopes be trusted? With all those integrated circuits, you don't really see what's going on... So I built one myself, using nothing more than diodes, transistors, and resistors. Thus was born DOMINIC: the Digital Oscilloscope Module Including No Integrated Circuits.

## What I learnt in a nutshell
* How transistors really work
* That Zener diodes exist and how they work
* Soldering
* Drawing circuits on KiCad
* A lot about oscilloscopes
* Experience in testing circuits
