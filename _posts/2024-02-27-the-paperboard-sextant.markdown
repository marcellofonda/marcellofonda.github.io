Did you ever find yourself in the middle of the ocean, longing to know your position? If only you had a sextant with you... Don't worry, now you can build one yourself, with little more than some paperboard and a printer!

In a collaboration with [University College Luciano Fonda](collegiofonda.it), and as a preparation for [Trieste Next Science Festival](triestenext.it), I set out to build the world's first working paperboard sextant! Ok, just kidding, I don't know if it's really the first one... though it might be! And it works, even though you won't know your position with less than a dozen miles of error.


## What I learnt in a nutshell

* Technical drawing in LibreCAD
* Challenges of making a rigid structure out of paperboard, while maintaining precision
* The optical principles of the sextant
