I am a passionate learner with a smile. 

I love to dive head-first into the most interesting subjects of all realms of knowledge: I graduated my bachelor in Physics in 2023, but I also took part in international competitions in Earth Science (IESO 2016) and Biology (IBO 2019). My true calling is as a Theoretician, but, as you can find out from my projects list, I enjoy getting my hands dirty with experiments, lab projects, and simulations. 

I love art, music, and sports. I found a wonderful blend of the latter two in the Brazilian martial art Capoeira, which I have been practicing since 2019. Among my hobbies are sailing, drawing, writing poetry, and playing the trumpet.
